**Data Set**  
This data set contains 12 columns attributes for each soccer athlete from different countries:  

uid, name,age, height_cm, weight_kg, nationality, overall, team_position, pace, shooting, defending, physic  

We can use those data to do analysis by different dimensions. Let's Map-Reduce!
